Greetings! I am Mark, a Ph.D. student specializing in computational genetics at Uppsala University. My research involves analyzing vast genetic data sets through statistical tools to uncover the intricate genetic architecture of growth-relative traits. I enjoy traveling and immersing myself in diverse cultures when I am not in the lab. It has always been a passion of mine to discover new places and broaden my horizons.
